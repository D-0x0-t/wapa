# WAPA
Wireless Access Point Auditor (TFG)
### What is WAPA?
**WAPA** is a tool designed for wireless pentesters.
It all started as a _FDP_ (final degree project), but it's free to use and it's going to be constantly updated until the project is done.
### What does WAPA do?
WAPA is focused in:
1. Sniff wireless trafic
2. Inject packets in 802.11 networks
3. Crafting packets with [Scapy](https://scapy.net/)
4. Centralize all known exploits/attacks for 802.11
5. Make it easy for new-users not acquainted with terminal commands, with a special GUI based in PHP and Apache
